					<h2>Description</h2>

					<p>
					<b>Super Tank</b> is one of two original games manufactured by German company
					Video Games GmbH.  Released in 1981, it was licensed to SNK for the Japanese
					market and Computran for the US Market.
					</p>

					<p>
					In <b>Super Tank</b>, up to two players simultaneously control highly mobile
					armored tanks on a mission to destroy the SUPER TANK.  An introductory
					collection round challenges the players to clear a field of mines and
					destroy as many red enemy tanks as possible.  Special glowing diamonds
					are scattered throughout, providing temporary super armor protection
					and making the players&rsquo; task easier.
					</p>

					<p>
					After clearing the field of mines, the players are ready for their
					confrontation with the SUPER TANK!  The SUPER TANK is this game&rsquo;s most
					dangerous adversary.  It is a highly-maneuverable vehicle with a
					single weakness at the tip of its nozzle.  A direct hit on the nozzle
					will destroy the SUPER TANK, bringing the players to another more
					intricate collection round where the challenges are greater and so are
					the rewards.
					</p>

					<p>
					Oddly enough, the German and Japanese versions of the game&rsquo;s flyer
					depict a flower-laden, treaded vehicle with the head and body of a
					Roman gentleman, much like a centaur.  This vehicle is shown shooting
					water at other similar vehicles out of his elongated nose.  It is
					thought that restrictions against war games and cultural standards
					were responsible for these gentle depictions of the military-themed
					action in the game.
					</p>
