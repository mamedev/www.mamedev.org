	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>
	<b>Super Tank</b> is one of two original games manufactured by German company
	Video Games GmbH.  Released in 1981, it was licensed to SNK for the Japanese
	market and Computran for the US Market.
	</p>

	<p>
	In <b>Super Tank</b>, up to two players simultaneously control highly mobile
	armored tanks on a mission to destroy the SUPER TANK.  An introductory
	collection round challenges the players to clear a field of mines and
	destroy as many red enemy tanks as possible.  Special glowing diamonds
	are scattered throughout, providing temporary super armor protection
	and making the players&rsquo; task easier.
	</p>

	<p>
	After clearing the field of mines, the players are ready for their
	confrontation with the SUPER TANK!  The SUPER TANK is this game&rsquo;s most
	dangerous adversary.  It is a highly-maneuverable vehicle with a
	single weakness at the tip of its nozzle.  A direct hit on the nozzle
	will destroy the SUPER TANK, bringing the players to another more
	intricate collection round where the challenges are greater and so are
	the rewards.
	</p>

	<p>
	Oddly enough, the German and Japanese versions of the game&rsquo;s flyer
	depict a flower-laden, tracked vehicle with the head and body of a
	Roman gentleman, much like a centaur.  This vehicle is shown shooting
	water at other similar vehicles out of his elongated nose.  It is
	thought that restrictions against war games and cultural standards
	were responsible for these gentle depictions of the military-themed
	action in the game.
	</p>
