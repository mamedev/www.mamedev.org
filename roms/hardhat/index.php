					<h2>Description</h2>

					<b>Hard Hat</b> is a unique logic game with an educational puzzle to solve.  It
					was designed and programmed for Exidy by Larry W. Hutcherson Sr. and released in 1982.
					Touted as the &ldquo;First Educational Coin-Op Game&rdquo;, you play a busy carpenter
					that is constantly being chased by hammers and whirlwinds throughout a grid of
					scaffolding while manipulating letters to spell &ldquo;E-X-I-D-Y&rdquo; or
					&ldquo;H-A-R-D-H-A-T&rdquo;.  Controls consist of a simple 4-direction joystick,
					both players alternating use during a two player game.
					</p>

					<p>
					The hardware is identical to another Exidy game, <b>Pepper II</b>.
