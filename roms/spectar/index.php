					<h2>Description</h2>
			        <p><b>Spectar</b>, released by Exidy in 1980, is the follow-up to <a href="../targ/">Targ</a>.
			        Gameplay is apparently unchanged, you control a vehicle called Whummel into a 9x9 grid maze,
			        chasing down, and being chased by, the alien invaders. Targs have evolved into the more dangerous
			        Rammers, and Spectars appears more often, shooting at player's ship.</p>

			        <p>You use a 4 way joystick to guide your vehicle in the maze, and a pushbutton to shoot at
			        enemies. Up to two players can alternate in gameplay.</p>

			        <p>The most noticeable difference from his predecessor is that to complete a level you must now
			        collect all the gems in the maze, in a Pacman-like game. Rammers and Spectars continue to appear
			        from flashing pods, so you cannot rest and plan your course easily, or you will be overwhelmed by
			        the alien force.</p>

			        <p>Graphic is highly improved compared to his predecessor: the maze now has barricades that must
			        be avoided or can be used as a shielding against the enemies, and has ten environement settings,
			        changing from the "square-block town" of Targ to a city, a forest, a lunar landscape and many more.
			        The enemies too are smarter and faster, and the fact that they go on spawning from the pods makes the game
			        a even more frenzy challenge.</p>
