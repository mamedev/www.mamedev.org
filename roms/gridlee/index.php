	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>
	<b>Gridlee</b> is a game that was never released. It was developed by Videa, Inc. in 1982, on
	hardware designed by <a href="http://www.blueneptune.com/~delman/" target="_blank">Howard Delman</a>.
	Videa was eventually acquired by Pizza Time Theater and formed the core of their new
	Sente Technologies division. The hardware that  <b>Gridlee</b> ran on evolved into the
	Bally/Sente SAC I system, which provided a cartridge-based arcade gaming platform that
	supported such games as <b>Snake Pit</b>, <b>Stocker</b>, and <b>Hat Trick</b>.
