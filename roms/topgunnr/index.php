					<h2>Description</h2>

					<p>
					<b>Top Gunner</b>, released in 1986, is said to be the last vector graphic
					game produced for the arcades.  Designed to run on Fifty 50&rsquo;s XCD-1
					Simulator System(TM) hardware, <b>Top Gunner</b> was played sitting down in a
					full cockpit-style motion cabinet.  The motion of the player&rsquo;s seat
					followed the action of the flight simulator-style gameplay, providing
					the player a unique, immersive arcade experience.  The player
					interacted with the machine via a dual-axis flight yoke, a throttle
					lever, and the standard coin slot, start, and fire buttons.
					</p>

					<p>
					Vic Tolomei was the primary software developer for <b>Vertigo</b> and <b>Top
					Gunner</b>, Howell Ivy was responsible for the hardware, and Pete Kaufmann
					and Ken Nicholson designed the graphics and audio respectively.
					</p>

					<p>
					The game <b>Vertigo</b>, produced roughly two years before <b>Top Gunner</b>,
					is thought to be its prototype.  <b>Vertigo</b> was shopped around but never
					picked up due to poor location test results and excessive hardware costs.
