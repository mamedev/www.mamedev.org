					<h2>Description</h2>

					<p>
					<b>FAX</b> is a trivia game which asks questions about a number of topics, including:
					General Knowledge, Sports, History and Entertainment.  This was released by Exidy in 1983 and
					written by Vic Tolomei and Larry Hutcherson hopeful to play on the Trivial Pursuit craze as
					it was released over a year earlier than the registered Trivial Pursuit versions (produced by Bally/Sente).
					</p>

					<p>
					The game came in what was essentially a jukebox cabinet (complete with a woodgrain finish), which lent
					itself to possible markets outside of the typical arcade setting.  It had a 9-inch monitor mounted in
					the center, logo on the bezel itself and a row of buttons on each side of the screen to accommodate
					two player simultaneous play.  FAX used unique compression to hold nearly 3700 questions in as small
					of storage as possible.  Exidy also sold several EPROM replacement kits that provided new questions
					but they are nearly impossible to find today.
