                 	<p>
                 	The code in MAME is the work of hundreds of developers, each
                 	of whom owns the copyright to the code they wrote. There is no central
                 	copyright authority you can license the code from. The proper way to use 
                 	the MAME source code is to examine it, using it to understand how the games 
                 	worked, and then write your own emulation code. Sorry, there is no free
                 	lunch here.

                 	<b>Q. Can I include MAME with my product?</b><br/>

                 	A. Yes. You can use 3-clause BSD compliant files but project as whole is under GPL-2.0 <a href="#license">license</a>
					so in case you wish to use those part you need approval from specific developers.

                 	<p>
                 	<b>Q. Can I sell my product with the MAME logo on it?</b><br/>

                 	A. No. Putting the logo on your product makes it appear that the product is
                 	something officially endorsed by Gregory Ember, and constitutes <a href="#trademark">trademark</a>
                 	infringement.

                 	<b>Q. Can I use the MAME logo to advertise my product?</b><br/>

                 	A. No. Using the logo in your advertising makes it appear that the product is
                 	something officially endorsed by Gregory Ember, and constitutes <a href="#trademark">trademark</a>

                 	<b>Q. Can I use the term "MAME" in the name of my software?</b><br/>

                 	A. Generally, no, especially if it is something that is sold. However, if you
                 	are producing a free MAME-related piece of software, it is common that
                 	permission is granted. <a href="contact.html">Send a query</a> to double-

                 	<p>
                 	<b>Q. Can I put an arcade cabinet running MAME in a public location?</b><br/>

                 	A. Yes, but please note that you also need to have rights to ROMS you are using.
                 	</p>
                 	
                 	<p>
                 	<b>Q. Can my non-profit use MAME or an arcade cabinet running MAME to help raise money?</b><br/>

                 	A. Yes, but please note that you also need to have rights to ROMS you are using.
                 	</p>
                 	                 	
                 	<p>
                 	<b>Q. Is it legal to download ROMs for a game when I own the PCB?</b><br/>
                 	
                 	A. This is unclear and depends on where you live. In most cases you would need
                 	to obtain permission from the original manufacturer to do so.
                 	</p>
                 	
                 	<p>
                 	<b>Q. What about the free ROMs on the MAME site? Can I use those with my product?</b><br/>
                 	
                 	A. Almost all of the free ROMs on the MAME site are licensed only for non-
                 	commercial use, and only for distribution from the MAME site. Just because
                 	they are available for "free" here does not grant further redistribution
                 	rights, nor does it allow you to treat them as "freebies" for commercial
                 	use.
                 	</p>
                 	
                 	<p>
                 	<b>Q. If I obtain a license from an original manufacturer to distribute the ROMs can I use MAME to run them?</b><br/>
                 	
                 	A. Generally, yes, but we can not give any support without proof that such a license has
                 	already been obtained.
                 	</p>
                 	
                 	<p>
                 	<b>Q. Can I use a PC running MAME to replace a real arcade PCB?</b><br/>
                 	
                 	A. In order to do this you would have to use a copy of the original  
					ROMs, which would require obtaining permission from the original  
					manufacturer. Once you had permission from them, if it was used for  
					non-commercial purposes, then you would not technically be violating  
					the MAME license. However we still do not explicitly give permission  
					to use MAME in this way because of the possibility of the game being  
					sold sometime later, which would constitute commercial use of MAME. If  
					you sell your game later you must sell it without MAME included.
                 	</p>
                 	
                 	<p>
                 	<b>Q. Can I ask for donations for the work I did on my port of MAME to platform X?</b><br/>
                 	
                 	A. No. You would be earning money from the MAME trademark and that is forbidden.
 					It is our wish that MAME remain free for all.
