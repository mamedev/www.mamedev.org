					The email you entered has been forwarded to the appropriate people on the MAME team. Thanks for the
					feedback!

					<p>
					<b>IMPORTANT WARNING:</b> We get tons of email. Although we do not have time to respond to most of it (except
					important legal matters), your email will be read. To increase your chances of a response, ask only 
					simple questions that will have a short answer that don't require too much difficult thinking.
					</p>

					<p>
					<b>KEEP IN MIND</b> this is not a support line. We do not offer support for how to compile the source
					code or use MAME itself. There are many sites on the internet dedicated to answering these questions.
					Go seek them out by looking at the links page, available on the left hand side menu.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					<b>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES</b> will we respond or even look at your email if you are asking us to send 
					you ROMs, or if you ask us where to download ROMs for free. You get ROMs by purchasing a game or PCB off 
					of <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank">eBay</a> and then using a ROM reader to read the data
					into your PC.
