		<h2>What's New?</h2>

		<p>
		A project as big as MAME certainly has had its ups and downs during the course of its existence. A comprehensive list of what has changed in the project from a source code point of view is 
		available in the various whatsnew.txt files that can be found on the <a href="oldrel.html">Previous Releases</a> page. The content of these files has also been extracted into our wiki in the <a href="http://wiki.mamedev.org/index.php/Previous_MAME_Versions">Previous MAME Versions</a> section.

		<h2>Supported ROMs</h2>

		<p>
		An alternate measure of the success of the project is to simply count the number of supported sets. The chart at the right (click for a larger view) shows the overall trend since the beginning.

		<h2>Daily Work-in-Progress 1999-2004</h2>
		
		<p>
		Another fascinating way to look back at the project's history is to peruse the incredibly detailed Daily MAME Work-in-Progress (WIP) pages. From <a href="oldwip/wip9902.html">Feburary 1999</a> through <a href="oldwip/wip0407.html">July 2004</a>, Santeri Saarimaa took on the challenging task of maintaining a detailed daily work-in-progress report of MAME development. These page represent a peek into what was happening during one of the most active times in the project's development.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Tables</h2>
		
		<p>
		Two tables are provided for people that want to know more about the project's history.<br>
		The first one right below, lists what are considered major milestones of the project.
		</p>
		<p>
		Then there is a much bigger table (super-set of the one below), listing every MAME (and MESS) release, important milestones, date of release, number of parents, clones, devices, CHD (for MAME only), Mechanical and non-working sets. These data are also used for the graph.
