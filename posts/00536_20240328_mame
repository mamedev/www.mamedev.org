Updated requirements for compiling MAME

<p>We’re soon going to start requiring newer versions of some tools and
libraries to compile MAME.  The oldest versions of tools and libraries
we will officially support will be:</p>

<ul>
    <li>GCC 10.3</li>
    <li>clang 11.0</li>
    <li>SDL 2.0.14</li>
    <li>Qt 5.15</li>
    <li>GNU libstdc++ 10.3</li>
    <li>LLVM libc++ 11.0</li>
</ul>

<p>Some older versions of clang, Qt, GNU libstdc++ and LLVM libc++ may
continue to work for a while, but no effort will be made to maintain
support.</p>

<p>The oldest supported tools and libraries are approximately three
years old.  Examples of environments that provide sufficiently
up-to-date tools and libraries include Ubuntu Linux 22.04LTS, Fedora
Linux 33 and macOS 11.0 “Big Sur” with Xcode 12.5.</p>
