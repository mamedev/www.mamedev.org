CPU requirements for Windows binary MAME releases

<p>If you’ve been following along, you’ll no doubt realise that MAME
development is off to a flying start in 2025.  Perhaps the most exciting
feature coming in the next release is a native recompiler for 64-bit
ARMv8 systems.  This includes Apple Silicon, recent Raspberry Pi models,
and the most popular Android devices.</p>

<p>After several years, we’ve decided it’s time to start taking
advantage of features of newer (or at least slightly less outdated)
CPUs.  Starting with MAME 0.274, official Windows binary releases will
require so-called x86-64-v2 features.  These features have been
available in all popular x86-64 CPUs for close to a decade.  They were
introduced in the following CPU families:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Intel “Nehalem” (2008), or “Silvermont” (2013) for low-power CPUs</li>
    <li>AMD “Bulldozer” (2011), or “Jaguar” (2013) for low-power CPUs</li>
    <li>VIA “Nano C” and “Eden C” (both 2015)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you still want to run up-to-date versions of MAME on older systems
running Windows, you’ll need to compile it from the source code.</p>
