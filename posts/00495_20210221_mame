Thank You, FOSDEM '21!

<p>In case you missed our presentation at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/">
FOSDEM ’21</a> (FOSDEM - Free and Open source Software Developers'
European Meeting) on Saturday, February 6, 2021, we've uploaded the
video that MAME's development and release manager Vas Crabb ("cuavas")
contributed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ynwwJKlNQipcym48qPI3A">our very own YouTube channel!</a></p>

<p>(Don't worry, it’s not all that technical - Vas created the presentation
to be approachable no matter the skill level or whether the viewer is
new to MAME or not.)</p>

<p>Thanks go to FOSDEM's organizers for a great weekend's worth of
presentations embracing and supporting the open source community.</p>

<p>Due to technical issues early on Saturday, our live Q&A was not
recorded.</p>
