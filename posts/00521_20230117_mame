Release Schedule Adjustments

<p>Hi everyone!  Hopefully you all had a great New Year if you celebrate
that kind of thing, and hopefully you’ve had some time to enjoy
MAME 0.251 as well!  All of us at MAMEdev agree 2022 was a massive year
for MAME development, and we want to thank everyone who’s helped achieve
that.  MAME wouldn’t be what it is without all your contributions,
whether it’s bug reports, pull requests, pre-release testing, helping
out new users, or just letting us know that you appreciate our work.</p>

<p>We’ve got some really big stuff in the pipeline, but it’s going to
take a bit longer than usual to make sure it’s ready for prime time.  As
such, there won’t be a January MAME release this year, but we’re fairly
confident we can have MAME 0.252 out by the end of February.  If you
want a taste of some of the things that are coming, you can get the very
latest source code from our <a
href="https://github.com/mamedev/mame/">repository on GitHub</a> and
compile it by following the <a
href="https://docs.mamedev.org/initialsetup/compilingmame.html">instructions
on our documentation site</a>.  Once again, thanks for your continued
support, and have an awesome 2023!</p>
