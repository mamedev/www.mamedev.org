MAMEdev presents: Video Klein

<p>Thanks to the kind generosity of Wolfgang Nottebaum, managing
director of Video Klein Automatenbau GmbH, we can provide ROMs for
several German video poker games.  The ROMs are freely available for
personal use.  Most of the games come from Video Kleinâ€™s popular Witch
Card series.  Notably, Witch Strike is one of the many games designed to
comply with the letter of laws banning video poker games by eschewing
playing card graphics and gambling terminology.</p>

<p>The ROMs are available for download from our <a
href="https://www.mamedev.org/roms/">ROMs page</a>.  All the games have
internal artwork that shows the control panel button lamps.  The buttons
are clickable if you run MAME in windowed mode with mouse capture
disabled.  For games that require initial setup, instructions are
provided on the download pages.</p>
