See you at FOSDEM!

<p>MAME developer Vas Crabb will be giving a talk at <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2021/">FOSDEM ’21</a>.  Due to the ongoing
pandemic and associated movement restrictions, FOSDEM ’21 will be held
online.  This is great news for a lot of us, because it means we can
attend without having to travel to Belgium.  Vas will be speaking in
the <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/emulator_development/">Emulator
Development room</a>, on Saturday 6 February, from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM,
Central European time (UTC+1).  The hour will include a presentation
followed by a live Q&amp;A session.  There’s information on how to
attend and participate <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2021/practical/online/">here</a>.</p>
