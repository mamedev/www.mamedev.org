No December MAME Release

<p>Hi everyone!  As you’re no doubt aware, the end of November is fast
approaching, and we’re gearing up to get MAME 0.261 out.  We’re very
excited about some of the systems that have been brought up this month,
which you’ll know about if you’ve been <a
href="https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commits/master">following
development</a> in our git repository.</p>

<p>We won’t have a MAME release at the end of December.  Instead, we’ll
have a two-month development cycle culminating in a release at the end
of January.  Enjoy the end-of-year holidays if you’re taking a break, or
hang in there if you’re working all the way through.  Development won’t
stop, and you can always build from the very latest source code if you
want a preview of what’s coming in the next release.</p>
